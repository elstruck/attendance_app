# attendance_app
Taking attendance of students in the classroom.

<p>Attendance_App uses javascript and comma-seperated-data to list students in my classroom. The students come up and click on their name and it changes color to green.
The webapp can be opened on mobile device and "Save to Homescreen" to create a native app feel.
Right now, the app doesn't submit data, and data erases if app closes.</p>
<p>There are a lot of features I would like to add eventually. Feel free to submit ideas!</p>
Goals: <br />
<ul>
    <li>Create different tabs for classes/categories</li>
    <li>Import from .csv file or MySQL database (or similar)</li>
    <li>User login capabilities, possibly FB, Google, and Twitter</li>
    <li>User has own class/team with user specific options.</li>
</ul>
